description: My Day is a stylish countdown application.<br><br>Although it seems very simple but it isn't. I got a lot of legacy code and had to rewrite all critical parts one by one. Eventually I was able to update architecture, improve stability and implement new features.<br><br>While developing App Widget I faced several issues and wrote <a href="https://yalantis.com/blog/the-dark-side-of-android-app-widgets/" target="blank">an article</a> about it.<br><br>I had to work in the conditions of quick change of requirements because customer experimented with monetization methods.<br><br>After all changes the amount of users began to grow. Now application has more than <b>1 billion downloads</b>.
