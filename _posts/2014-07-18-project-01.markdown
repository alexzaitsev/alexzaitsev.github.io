description: Initially Flights is a mobile client for <a href="http://aviascanner.net" target="blank">aviascanner.net</a> site and later became part of <a href="http://any.travel" target="blank">any.travel</a> ecosystem.<br><br>This application is very quick and clear way to buy cheap air tickets. KISS and speed were main requirements. It doesn't have any additional functionality because we wanted to keep it simple. And we made it - <b>1 billion downloads</b> is great metric!<br><br>I was engaged in a full cycle of development&#58; helping client with requirements, understanding his problems and offering solutions, developing, testing, even a little bit designing, helping to publish to Google Play.<br><br>We communicated via Skype chat and e-mails and we have never faced any troubles in understanding each other.
